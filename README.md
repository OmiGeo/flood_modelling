Flood water level prediction using machine learning algorithams
In this project a water level prediction model developed for Valapatnam River, kerala. 
input parameter Rainfall, HUmidity, Tempreature taken data collected from the NASA power access for time period of 2015 - 2020. 
The water level is taken as the dependent variable and the water level data taken from WRIS portal. 
The data is preprocessed and finally the model developed using ANN, RF, Decison Tree, KNN, Linear regression. 
Model evaluated using R2, RMSE, MAE.
